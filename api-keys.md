# API Keys

Magic Mirror calls a few external APIs directly from your browser. Most of them are free and keyless, but one requires a personal API key that you enter in the app's Settings screen. Your key is stored only in your browser (`localStorage`) and is never sent anywhere except directly to the API it belongs to.

## Geocode Maps API key (required for weather/location)

Magic Mirror uses [Geocode Maps.co](https://geocode.maps.co/) to turn your city/country/zip code into map coordinates for weather lookups.

1. Go to [geocode.maps.co](https://geocode.maps.co/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Copy your API key from your account dashboard.
3. Paste it into the "Geocode Maps API Key" field in Magic Mirror's Settings screen.

The free tier has a rate limit, but it's more than enough for a single device checking the weather every couple of minutes.

## OpenWeatherMap API key (optional)

Weather icons are currently served from OpenWeatherMap's keyless public icon CDN, so no key is required for icons to work today. The optional "OpenWeatherMap API Key" field in Settings is reserved for future use if that changes.

If you'd like one anyway, sign up at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/appid) for a free API key.

## A note on key exposure

Because these keys are used directly from your browser, they are visible in your browser's network requests and history. This is expected and fine for free-tier, low-privilege keys like these — just don't reuse a key that's tied to a paid plan or sensitive account.
